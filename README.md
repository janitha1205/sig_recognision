# signature recognision 

Signature is a unique identity of a person. Way he/she writes the signature is a structural significance of him/her self. Curvature of a signature is identical to a person. Way preserve curvature looks similar whether the person writes in any circumstance. Extract the curvature and transform into shape base identity is very much useful for identical once recognition. When a wrong person gets a person's signature , typically the structural identity cannot be the same as the real person because curvature matches cannot be repeated from fake to real stance. This signature base verification is very much useful for modern world transactions.

Normally the signature as it is a unique curvature for a selected individual. The proposed mechanism should consist of identification of collection of curvatures that frugment the whole as it is. Usually there are two ways of fragmentation: one is up to the bottom and the other one is left to right. So there is a rule of thumb that thickness reduces in such a way that it minimizes to one single pixel at a one vertical or horizontal space.orelse the system cannot get smooth curvatures.

After feeding single pixel curvature, there should be a way to segment separation of selected particular curvature into a sum of different curvatures which can be done from vertical or horizontal based segmentation the selected routes iteratively segment from scanning through the up to bottom or vice versa.

After choosing the set of curvatures, develop a mechanism to establish dimensional reduction point of view. There is an algorithm to obtain unique features of curvature into a set of values that can describe the curvature such as frequency with amplitude basis in cos or sin basis so that  the frequency plot for each set of curvatures is obtained.

There is a way that those sets of frequency plots sum up and obtain one frequency plot. After that one single plot can make it to one single set of parameters unique to a particular signature. Then the plot can establish a methodological way to find the correlation to plot with others such a mechanism able to identify features of a signature into one single feature set. Using distance based regression methodology applied to make it comparison.
